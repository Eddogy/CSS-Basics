				<p>Sofa was a small design-centered software company, founded by three guys who taught themselves how to code and make apps.
				Next to building and selling products, Sofa fueled its growth through design contracting work and quickly became known as a world-class design studio and software company. As our team and product portfolio grew, we moved away from contracting and focused fully on our own Mac, iOS and web products.

				<header><h2>Work <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></h2></header>
				<p>When we started Sofa in 2006, we set out to make friendly and useful products that matter to people.
				Over the years, we built an awesome team of designers and developers around this mission. Together, we created great software that many people use and enjoy every day. That's something we'll always be proud of.
				We expected to keep working at Sofa forever. But after Facebook first made contact, we were quickly convinced to join forces.
